		Welcome to my site! The TL;DR is I started coding seriously in 2014 and I've been lucky enough to work in a lot of different
		environments - startups, local businesses, contracting, big companies you've heard of (Disney/Hulu), and crypto.

					I'm a full-stack engineer, but I tend to work on the frontend more than the backend. I've done a lot with React and TypeScript on
					the frontend, and I work with Node.js or Python on the backend. I find trying new technologies regularly - like GraphQL or the
					aforementioned Svelte - keeps things interesting.
